# Creating and Using a Custom API  
  
  
  
**Purpose:** Class assignment

This is probably my favorite project from my web design class. Because of school restrictions, I had to use replit to deploy my API, so it doesn't work 24/7, *but* most of the time is enough for me. This was my first time working with databases for websites, which I'd been looking forward to since a previous quiz app project. The site is a very basic, not well styled ticketing application with virtually no security, and it allows the user to submit a ticket--an issue, or maybe feedback for a business--and for someone to login as an admin and process the ticket.
