Unfortunately, the API used for this project looks like it's no longer being maintained, so some links and products may not load/work properly. However, this project was still great practice for using JS to dynamically create and delete elements, and I especially enjoyed creating the search function to find products quickly.

What I least liked about this website was the loading times. For every page, I had all the products under the category load at once, which was still tolerable since the API doesn't have that many products, but is definitely not scalable, and even at such a small scale, it's still incredibly slow and could be much better. Below are a few screenshots of the site.
