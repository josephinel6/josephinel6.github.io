# Creating and Using a Custom API  
  
  
  
**Purpose:** Class assignment  
**Link:** https://sql-styled.josephinemouse.repl.co/    

This is probably my favorite project from my web design class. Because of school restrictions, I had to use replit to deploy my API, so it doesn't work 24/7, *but* most of the time is enough for me. This was my first time working with databases for websites, which I'd been looking forward to since a previous quiz app project. The site is a very basic, not well styled ticketing application with virtually no security, and it allows the user to submit a ticket--an issue, or maybe feedback for a business--and for someone to login as an admin and process the ticket.  

Here are some photos of the login pages, which I spent the most time on style-wise:

The menu bar, which unfortunately only exists on a few pages since I spent most of my time on this project figuring out how to use SQLite and create an API:

The profile from the admin side:

If, as an admin, you click "respond" to a ticket, it automatically opens a blank email with the user's email and the ticket number as the subject line (in hindsight, it should've been the ticket title):

\
After clicking respond, the ticket will move to "In Progress", and from there you can move it to "Completed":

The place to edit an admin profile, as well as the only page you can see the menu from on the admin side...:
