I lead a team of three in redesigning Ignite Robotics' website on Squarespace.

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to capture my work while it was still hosted on Squarespace, so not all pages are here, and many of them have been a little mis-formtated by new adjustments. However, below are screenshots I did get--a combination of screenshots taken then, unlisted pages still active (navbar and formatting may be off, I have cropped the navbar in a few as to only preserve my own work), and help from Wayback Machine.
