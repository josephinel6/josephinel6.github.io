## Project Writeup

Runner up for Best Functionality | View our project page [here](https://dash.hackpnw.org/projects/z1i6pjs9s1dcxz1p)

### Inspiration

Our original inspiration for this site was to help people memorize names. It sucks being new to a community, and that experience is made even worse when you're struggling to memorize dozens of new names. Whether a teacher trying to get to know students or a new hire at a workplace, this boring task comes up at some point for everyone. Our site makes this easy and fun! With Name It, memorizing names is no longer a chore to dread. Name It can also be expanded to aid in studying vocabulary, scientific concepts, historical dates, and other large amounts of information, which can be tedious.

### What it does

Name It is an interactive website designed to help users learn and remember people’s names through different game modes. Users upload a file containing the names and pictures of people. They are then presented with three game options: typing a name given an image, matching the photo to a given name, or playing a crossword. For the first two games, the score is increased based on the number of correct questions the user gets right. The crossword is created using several of the names from the file and the user has to fill in the names based on picture hints.

### How we built it

We used HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to build our website, then deployed it through Github pages.

### Challenges we ran into

We had two main challenges. First, the crossword game was particularly tough to code. We had to loop through all the names in a way that would pick out names to join together based on the letters they contained. Our UI was also a challenge. We wanted the interface to be comprehensive but also very clean, and we spent a lot of time on designing and implementing it.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We love our GUI and how user-friendly our game modes are. It takes virtually no extra instruction for the user to upload their photos and begin playing. Additionally, the interface is designed to be very visually appealing and fun to use. We are also proud of accomplishing what was our biggest challenge—dealing with the crossword game mode.

### What we learned

We learnt from our challenges in our code and acquired better problem-solving skills. We implemented what we learnt from the Github and deploying workshops.
