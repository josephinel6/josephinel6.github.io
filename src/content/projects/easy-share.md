This is intended to be a "remake" of my first crud app (/project-images/easyshare/see [here](josephinel6.github.io/projects/my-first-api)). Working on it not only taught me a lot about creating back-end applications and deploying to Vercel (mainly, troubleshooting CORS issues) but also made me comfortable working with the MERN stack.

Below are some images of the site. It is designed to mirror the pencil-and-paper anonymous "suggestions box" some institutions may have, or similar kind of anonymous "question boxes" used in classrooms. My original app, referenced above, was more of a full ticketing system with that required each user to log in to submit a ticket and had specific admin accounts. I wanted to do something different enough that it wasn't boring to recreate, but similar enough that it still captured the same main concepts.

Please excuse the poor naming leftover from testing.
