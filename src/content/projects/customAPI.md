This is from my web design class and was my first time working with databases for websites, which I'd been looking forward to since a previous quiz app project.

The site is a very basic, not well styled ticketing application with virtually no security, and it allows the user to submit a ticket--an issue, or maybe feedback for a business--and for someone to login as an admin and process the ticket. This is the inspiration for one of my later projects.

Here are some photos of the login pages, which I spent the most time on style-wise (you can tell):

![](/images/firstSQL_2.png)

The homescreen and submission page:  
![](/images/firstSQL_3.png)
![](/images/firstSQL_4.png)

The menu bar, which unfortunately only exists on a few pages since I spent most of my time on this project figuring out how to use SQLite and create an API:

To view your tickets:  
![](/images/firstSQL_6.png)

Edit your profile:  
![](/images/firstSQL_7.png)
![](/images/firstSQL_8.png)
![](/images/firstSQL_9.png)

Admin login:  
![](/images/firstSQL_10.png)

The profile from the admin side:  
![](/images/firstSQL_11.png)

If, as an admin, you click "respond" to a ticket, it automatically opens a blank email with the user's email and the ticket number as the subject line (in hindsight, it should've been the ticket title):  
![](/images/firstSQL_12.png)
![](/images/firstSQL_13.png)

After clicking respond, the ticket will move to "In Progress", and from there you can move it to "Completed":  
![](/images/firstSQL_14.png)
![](/images/firstSQL_15.png)

Edit admin profile, as well as the only page you can see the menu from on the admin side:  
![](/images/firstSQL_16.png)
![](/images/firstSQL_17.png)
![](/images/firstSQL_18.png)
