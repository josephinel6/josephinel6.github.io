# Responsiveness Using Bootstrap  
  
  
  
**Purpose:** Class assignment  
**Link:** https://responsivenessupload.josephinemouse.repl.co/  

There was an assignment to make a responsive photo-display website, so I decided to take the opportunity to experiment with as many photo effects as I could. Unfortunately, the most exciting part of the site, the photo editor, didn't end up being very responsive, but I've used the basic idea of the photo editor in another project with plans to make it better. Because of the animations, and because the site is centered around being responsive, it's hard to truly show the site in photos, so I'd encourage looking at the link, but below are a few photos nonetheless.
